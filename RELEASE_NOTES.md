# 🚀 RawView v3.9.1 Release Notes

**RawView v3.9.1** is a massive milestone release featuring a sleek tabbed Settings & Shortcuts interface with vector checkmarks, support for legacy Adobe Illustrator & Microsoft Office file formats, optional preview support for standard and web images (JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, ICO, BMP - off by default), and pre-checked Windows boot autostart in the setup installer.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v3.9.1

### ✅ 1. Crisp Vector Checkmarks (`✓`) in Preferences
* **Replaced Solid Blue Blocks**: Checkbox indicators across the Settings interface now feature a crisp, vector checkmark tick icon (`assets/checkmark.svg`) instead of a solid colored block, giving a modern and polished feel.
* **Refined Hover & Active States**: Smooth visual feedback with `#0284C7` background, `#38BDF8` border, and high-contrast white ticks.

### 🗂️ 2. Dual-Tabbed Settings Hub with Interactive Shortcuts Guide
* **`⚙️ Preferences` Tab**: Clean, organized configuration for Lifetime Pro activation, hover responsiveness slider (40ms–350ms), boot autostart, and categorized file format toggles.
* **`⌨️ Shortcuts & Controls` Tab**: Dedicated, visually rich instruction panel documenting all 9 keyboard and mouse controls with `<kbd>` badges and action summaries:
  * `Ctrl + \`` — Toggle preview service on/off system-wide
  * `Space` — Pin/unpin preview window or play/pause live video
  * `Mouse Wheel` — Smooth zoom in/out (50% to 800%)
  * `Left-Click + Drag` — Pan across zoomed canvas
  * `Double-Click` — Reset zoom & pan to 100% default fit
  * `Ctrl + C` — Copy full-resolution preview to Windows clipboard
  * `Ctrl + O` or `Enter` — Open file in default application
  * `Esc` — Immediately close and dismiss preview
  * `Mouse Hover Away` — Smooth zero-lag auto-dismissal when unpinned

### 🖼️ 3. Standard & Web Image Support (Disabled by Default)
* **New Format Support**: Instant hardware-accelerated previews for `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.ico`, and `.bmp`.
* **Off by Default**: Per user preference, standard images are **strictly unchecked by default** in settings so that RawView remains focused on specialized graphics and documents unless users explicitly check them.
* **High-Performance Rendering**: Includes EXIF auto-orientation, RGBA alpha checkerboard backdrop, downsampling optimization for large multi-megapixel photos, and GIF frame count / ICO multi-size metadata.

### 🏛️ 4. Legacy Adobe Illustrator & Microsoft Office Support
* **Illustrator v1–v8 (Legacy PostScript/EPS)**: Binary EPS header extraction (`0xC5D0D3C6` / `0xC6D3D0C5`) retrieving embedded TIFF previews for vintage Illustrator artwork without PDF compatibility streams.
* **Legacy Word (`.doc`) & RTF**: Binary text stream extraction providing readable document preview cards when Windows shell preview handlers are unavailable.
* **Legacy Excel (`.xls`)**: BIFF8 record parsing to extract sheet names and workbook metadata.
* **Two-Stage Shell Extraction**: Queries `IExtractImage` with full pipeline rendering before falling back to static icons.

### 🚀 5. Setup Installer Autostart Checked by Default
* **Pre-Checked Boot Option**: Updated Inno Setup installer script (`Flags: checkedonce`) so "Start RawView automatically when Windows boots" is pre-toggled during installation while remaining fully untickable by the user.

# 🚀 RawView v3.1.7 Release Notes

**RawView v3.1.7** introduces a major vector rendering overhaul for **Adobe Illustrator (.AI)** files — delivering crystal-clear 300 DPI vector previews, eliminating low-res thumbnail dependencies, fixing white-canvas false-blank detection, and adding high-definition Illustrator branded overview cards for unstreamed files.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v3.1.7

### 🎨 1. Vector-First Rendering for Adobe Illustrator (.AI)
* **Crystal-Clear Vector Quality**: Illustrator files now prioritize native vector rasterization via PyMuPDF and PDFium at up to 1440px and 300 DPI. Previews are razor-sharp, allowing users to zoom in from 50% up to 800% to inspect typography, curves, and fine details.
* **Eliminated False Overflow Skipping**: Previously, files with artwork, bleeds, or crop marks extending slightly outside the artboard (`has_overflow = True`) had vector rendering skipped completely, forcing RawView into low-res thumbnails. Vector rasterization is now always prioritized whenever vector elements exist.
* **Multi-Artboard Discovery**: Automatically inspects multi-artboard Illustrator documents, reporting active artboard details (e.g. `Artboard 1 of 4`) in the preview badge.

### 🔍 2. Precision Area-Downsampled Blank Canvas Detection
* **Eliminated False-Blank Rejections**: Previously, small vector graphics (such as garment neck labels, logos, or icons) occupying less than 5% of a white artboard were falsely flagged as "blank pages" by a naive 95% brightness threshold.
* **Area-Averaged Luminance Verification**: Replaced grid-based sampling with bilinear area downsampling. Pure blank pages are rejected cleanly, while designs with fine lines or small logos on white backgrounds render with 100% fidelity.

### 🛡️ 3. High-Definition Adobe Illustrator Overview Cards
* **Graceful Fallback for Non-PDF AI Files**: When designers save AI files with "Create PDF Compatible File" unchecked and without embedded thumbnails, RawView previously threw an unhandled exception with no preview window.
* **Dark Glassmorphic Overview Card**: RawView now parses PostScript header metadata (`%%BoundingBox`, `%%HiResBoundingBox`, `%%Creator`, `%%Title`) to render a sleek, branded Adobe Illustrator Overview Card (Amber `#FF9A00` badge, artboard canvas dimensions, creator version, file size, and descriptive status).

### ⚙️ 4. Thread-Safe Windows Shell Image Factory
* **Worker Thread COM Initialization**: Explicitly initializes COM apartments (`CoInitialize`) and safely frees GDI bitmap handles in background worker threads, preventing intermittent `E_INVALIDARG` failures.
* **Connected Worker Error Signals**: Connected background decode error signals to the application controller to eliminate silent drops and maintain robust logging.

# 🚀 RawView v3.1.6 Release Notes

**RawView v3.1.6** brings pixel-perfect high-zoom rendering and a new global `Ctrl+\`` keyboard shortcut to toggle hover previews on/off instantly from anywhere.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v3.1.6

### 🔍 1. Fixed Zoom Blur — Pixel-Perfect High-Zoom Rendering
* **Native Resolution Cap**: Zoom scaling is now capped at the source image's native pixel dimensions. Previously, zooming beyond the display-fit base size caused Qt to upscale beyond available pixel data, producing bilinear blur artifacts.
* **Adaptive Transformation Mode**: Zoom levels above 200% now use `FastTransformation` (nearest-neighbor) for crisp, pixel-perfect rendering — matching behavior in professional tools like Photoshop and Figma. Zoom levels at or below 200% continue to use `SmoothTransformation` (bilinear anti-aliasing) for a pleasant downscale appearance.
* **Impact**: All image formats (PSD, PSB, AI, EPS, PDF, TIFF, RAW, and more) benefit from sharp, clear zoom rendering from 50% up to 800%.

### ⌨️ 2. Global `Ctrl+\`` Hotkey — Instant Preview Toggle
* **System-Wide On/Off Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+\`` from anywhere on Windows (Explorer, Desktop, any window) to instantly enable or disable hover previews without opening the tray menu.
* **Tray Sync**: The System Tray menu checkbox automatically reflects the new state after each toggle.
* **Tray Notification**: A brief balloon notification confirms the current state — ✅ *Hover Preview Enabled* or ⏸ *Hover Preview Disabled*.
* **Auto-Dismiss**: Disabling via hotkey immediately dismisses any currently visible preview HUD.

# 🚀 RawView v3.1.5 Release Notes

**RawView v3.1.5** fixes a critical video source binding bug where `QMediaPlayer` attempted to load raw `.aep` / `.prproj` binary project paths instead of the resolved linked MP4/MOV footage, restoring instant, smooth 60 FPS live video playback for Adobe projects.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v3.1.5

### 🎬 1. Fixed Video Player Source Binding
* **Resolved Linked Video Playback Bug**: Fixed `FloatingPreviewHUD` to route the resolved `result.video_path` to `QMediaPlayer.setSource()`, eliminating black screen stalls on `.aep` and `.prproj` files.
* **Instant Footage Playback**: Linked video footages and rendered outputs (`Render/`, `Output/`, `Stock/`) now play immediately upon mouse hover with live timeline tracking.

---

# 🚀 RawView v3.1.4 Release Notes

### 🎬 1. Smart Linked Video & Footage Playback
* **Automatic Render & Output Resolution**: Discovers matching exported video files (`Render/`, `Output/`, `Export/`, or same directory) and plays them instantly in the preview HUD with 60 FPS muted looping.
* **Deep Timeline Footage Discovery**: Automatically resolves linked video footage clips (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, `.m4v`) referenced in the project timeline and plays them live on cursor hover.
* **Motion Graphics & Typography Visualizer**: For pure text/shape animation projects with no linked video footage, displays the high-contrast Typography & Motion Design showcase card with composition badges and layer properties.

---

# 🚀 RawView v3.1.3 Release Notes

### 🎬 1. Deep After Effects Composition & Layer Extraction
* **RIFX Project Tree Parsing**: RawView now inspects After Effects binary chunks to extract actual composition names (e.g. `50 TK`, `Outro`, `Intro Animation`) and linked footage assets.
* **Redesigned High-Definition Fallback Cards**: Upgraded to 640x420 RGB32 cards with dual-tile layout:
  * **Top Tile**: Displays numbered badges for active compositions and sequence timelines.
  * **Bottom Tile**: Displays file size, date modified, author, and linked assets with bright legible typography.
* **Eliminated Truncation & Low-Contrast Text**: Fixed clipping issues and replaced dull gray labels with vibrant, high-contrast Segoe UI typography.

---

# 🚀 RawView v3.1.2 Release Notes

### 🎯 1. Eliminated Generic Application Icon Fallbacks
* **Strict Visual Thumbnail Validation (`SIIGBF_THUMBNAILONLY`)**: Windows Shell image provider is now queried strictly for real visual page/slide thumbnails. Generic file association icons (such as upside-down Ae icons or blank paper icons) are blocked from display.
* **Embedded Slide & Document Media Extraction**: Office files (`.docx`, `.pptx`) automatically inspect embedded slide images and graphics if standalone thumbnails are not stored by Office.
* **High-Definition Creative Cloud & Office Cards**: When no visual thumbnail exists, RawView displays a dark branded overview card showing file name, sequence/document title, author, slide/sheet count, and file statistics.

---

# 🚀 RawView v3.1.1 Release Notes

### 📄 1. Microsoft Office & Document Previews
* **Microsoft Word (`.docx`, `.doc`, `.docm`, `.dotx`, `.dot`, `.rtf`)**: Zero-lag embedded OpenXML thumbnail extraction with page count, word count, document title, and author information.
* **Microsoft Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.xlsm`, `.xlsb`, `.xltx`, `.csv`)**: Instant spreadsheet previews displaying workbook title, sheet names (`Summary`, `Revenue`, etc.), and structural metadata.
* **Microsoft PowerPoint (`.pptx`, `.ppt`, `.pptm`, `.ppsx`, `.potx`)**: Slide deck overview showing slide counts, presentation titles, and high-resolution slide thumbnails.

### 🎬 2. Adobe Video & Motion Graphics Projects
* **Adobe After Effects (`.aep`, `.aet`, `.aepx`)**: Hardware-accelerated shell thumbnail rendering with composition structure and file statistics.
* **Adobe Premiere Pro (`.prproj`, `.prset`)**: Compressed project header inspector extracting project version, active sequence names, and video format information.

### ⚙️ 3. Redesigned Scrollable Settings Hub
* **Categorized Format Preferences**: Dedicated control groups for **Graphics & Design**, **Microsoft Office & Documents**, **Adobe Video Projects**, and **Live Video Playback**.
* **Responsive Scroll Viewport**: Settings dialog now dynamically fits all monitor resolutions with smooth vertical scrolling and sticky action buttons.

# 🚀 RawView v2.0.5 Release Notes

### 📂 1. Comprehensive Windows 11 Multi-Tab Support
- **Full Tab Discovery**: Fixed an issue where open tabs sharing the same top-level Explorer window handle would cause non-primary tabs to fail resolution.
- **Unified Tab Candidate Search**: All folder paths belonging to open tabs in the active window are dynamically discovered and queried, guaranteeing instant previews regardless of which tab is active.

---

# 🚀 RawView v2.0.4 Release Notes

### ⚡ 1. Resilient Hover Dwell & Resolution Engine
- **Fixed Hover State Lock**: Resolved an issue where hover state checks could prevent subsequent files from triggering preview popups.
- **Position-Based Settle Detection**: Previews now resolve exactly once per settled cursor position, ensuring instant response across List, Details, Grid, Icons, and Desktop views while maintaining zero UI thread usage during dwell.

---

# 🚀 RawView v2.0.3 Release Notes

### 🎬 1. Ultra-Smooth 60 FPS Live Video Previews
- **Zero Event-Loop Starvation**: Fixed an issue where continuous 35ms UIAutomation and Shell COM queries during mouse dwell starved Qt's event loop, causing dropped frames and stuttering playback.
- **Hardware Direct3D Video Output**: Configured `QVideoWidget` with native opaque hardware paint modes without CSS rasterization bottlenecks.
- **Throttled Repaints & Layout Updates**: Throttled progress bar and timestamp updates to eliminate redundant CPU/GPU drop-shadow blur passes.

---

## 🚀 RawView v2.0.2 Release Notes

### 🎯 1. Fixed Blank Space / Folder Background Hover Bug
- **Precise Item Detection**: Resolved an issue where hovering the cursor over empty whitespace / background areas of a folder window in Windows Explorer would inadvertently trigger a preview if the folder name matched any file inside.
- **Strict Row Containment**: The hover engine now requires the cursor to be directly inside a valid file item (`ListItemControl`, `DataItemControl`, or `TreeItemControl`). Moving into blank background space immediately dismisses any active preview without ghosting or lingering previews.

---

### ⏳ 2. 7-Day Unlimited Free Trial Engine
- **100% Unrestricted Access**: All features (Photoshop PSD/PSB, Illustrator AI, EPS, PDF, Camera RAW, TIFF, SVG, Live Video Playback, Deep Zoom) are completely unlocked for the first 7 days.
